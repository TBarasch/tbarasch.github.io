title: My first blog post
---

This is my very first blog post, which is rather awkward for me since my association with blogs is still stuck in the 90's, when blogs were mostly run by angsty teens hoping that the annonymity would allow them to work through high-school issues.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
